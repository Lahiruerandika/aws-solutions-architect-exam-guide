# Amazon S3

**Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Service) is one of the main building blocks of AWS, offering "infinitely scaling" storage. Itâ€™s designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time, from anywhere.

## S3 Buckets

- Amazon S3 stores objects (files) in **buckets**.
- **Buckets must have a globally unique name** across all AWS accounts.
- Buckets are created within specific **regions**.
  
### Bucket Naming Conventions:
- **No uppercase letters**.
- **No underscores**.
- Name must be **3-63 characters** long.
- **Cannot be an IP address** (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- Must start with a **lowercase letter** or **number**.

## S3 Objects

- An **object** in a bucket is a file stored in S3.
- Each object is identified by a **key** (essentially its full path), e.g.:
    - `s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt`
    - `s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt`
- The **key** consists of a **prefix** + **object name**:
    - `s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt`
- S3 does not use traditional **directories** in the way file systems do; instead, it uses keys with slashes ("/") to mimic directories.
  
### Object Details:
- **Max object size** in S3 is **5 TB**.
- For uploads **larger than 5 GB**, **multi-part upload** is required.
- Objects can have **metadata** (key-value pairs), which can be either system or user-defined.
- Objects can also have **tags** (Unicode key-value pairs) for purposes such as security and lifecycle management. A bucket can have up to **10 tags** per object.
- If versioning is enabled, each object will have a **version ID**.

## S3 Versioning

Versioning in S3 allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.

### Key Points:
- **Versioning** must be enabled at the **bucket level**.
- When a file with the **same key** (name) is uploaded, S3 will create a new version of the object. The previous version won't be overwritten; both versions will coexist.
  
### Benefits of Versioning:
- Protects files against unintended deletion.
- Enables rollback to previous versions if needed.
  
### Additional Notes:
- Files uploaded **before versioning is enabled** will have the version "null".
- **Suspending versioning** does not delete previous versions.
  
### Deleting Versioned Files:
- When a versioned file is deleted, a **delete marker** is added. The file is not deleted but can be restored by removing the delete marker.
- To **permanently delete** the file, both the delete marker and the object must be deleted.

## S3 Security

### Encryption at Rest

- AWS provides 4 methods of encryption for objects in S3
    1. SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled and managed by AWS
    2. SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
    3. SSE-C: the encryption keys are managed by the user
    4. Client Side Encryption
- SSE-S3:
    - Keys used for encryption is managed by Amazon S3
    - Objects are encrypted in the server side
    - It uses AES-256 encryption
    - In order to have SSE-S3 encryption clients must set a header, which is **x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**
- SSE-KMS:
    - Encryption keys are handled and managed by KMS
    - KMS allows the manage which keys will be used for the encryption, moreover it has audit trails in order to be able to see who was using the KMS key
    - Objects are encrypted in the server-side
    - In order to have SSE-S3 encryption clients must set a header, which is **x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"**
- SSE-C:
    - Server side encryption using data keys provided by the user from the outside of AWS
    - Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key provided by the user
    - Data should be transmitted through HTTPS, because a key is sent the AWS
    - Encryption key must be provided in the header of the request for every request
    - When retrieving the object, the same encryption key must be provided in the header
- Client Side Encryption:
    - Data must be encrypted before sending it to S3
    - This is usually accomplished by using a third party encryption library, like Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    - The user is solely responsible for encryption-decryption
    - The keys and the encryption cycle is managed by the user

### Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)

- Amazon S3 exposes:
    - HTTP endpoint for non-encrypted data
    - HTTPS endpoint for encryption in flight which relies on SSL/TLS
- Most clients for S3 will use HTTPS by default
- In case of SSE-C encryption HTTPS in mandatory

### S3 Security Overview

- User based security:
    - Accomplished by using IAM policies: specified which calls should be allowed for a specified sued from IAM console
- Resource based security:
    - Accomplished by using bucket policies which are bucket wide rules from the S3 console. These rules may allow cross account access to the bucket
    - We also have Object Access Control Lists (ACL) and Bucket Access Control Lists which allow finer grain control over the bucket
Note: an IAM principle can access an S3 object if:
    - The user IAM permission allows it or the resource policy allows it
    - The is no explicit deny

### S3 Bucket Policies

- Bucket policies are JSON based documents
- They can be applied to both buckets and objects in buckets
- The effect of a statement in the bucket policy can be either allow or deny
- The principle in the policy represents the account or the user for which the policy applies to
- Common use cases for S3 bucket policies:
    - Grant public access to the bucket
    - Force objects to be encrypted at the upload
    - Grant access to another account (cross account access)

### Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

- Relatively new settings that was created to block public access to buckets and objects if the account has some restrictions:
- S3 provides 4 different kind of block public access settings:
    - new access control lists
    - any access control lists
    - new public bucket or access point policies
    - block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
- These settings were created to prevent company data leaks

### S3 Other Security Features

- Networking:
    - S3 supports VPC Endpoints (for instances in VPC without internet access)
- Logging and Audit:
    - S3 Access Logs can be stored in other S3 buckets
    - API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
- User Security:
    - MFA Delete can be required in versioned buckets in order to protect for accidental deletions
    - Pre-Signed URLs: ULRs that are valid only for a limited time

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible from the internet
- The website URL will be something like this:
    - `<bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com`
    - `<bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com`
- In case of `403` errors we have to make sure that the bucket policy allows public reads

### CORS

- An origin is a scheme (protocol), host (domain) or port
- CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- CORS is a web browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main one
- Same origin example: http://example.com/app1 and http://example.com/app2
- Different origins: http://example.com and http://otherexample.com
- The request wont be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the request, using CORS headers (example: Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Method)

### S3 CORS

- If a client does a cross-origin request on an S3 bucket, the correct CORS headers need to be enabled in order for the request to succeed
- Request can be allowed for a specified origin (by specifying the URL of the origin) or for all origins (by using *)

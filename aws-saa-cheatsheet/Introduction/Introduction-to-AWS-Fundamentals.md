# Introduction to AWS Fundamentals

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services like computing power, storage, and databases. AWS provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, making it one of the most popular cloud platforms for businesses of all sizes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Cloud Computing**
   Cloud computing allows users to access computing resources over the internet without needing to own the physical infrastructure. AWS offers a broad set of cloud-based services including:
   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
   - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

### 2. **AWS Global Infrastructure**
   AWS operates data centers in multiple geographic regions, ensuring low latency, high availability, and fault tolerance. The key components are:
   - **Regions**: Physical locations where AWS data centers are grouped.
   - **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Data centers within a region that are isolated but connected for fault tolerance.

### 3. **Core AWS Services**
   - **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud.
   - **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable object storage for any amount of data.
   - **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational databases.
   - **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network in the cloud for your resources.

### 4. **Security and Compliance**
   AWS provides robust security features including encryption, identity management, and compliance with industry standards.

### 5. **AWS Pricing and Cost Management**
   AWS offers a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model with a **Free Tier** for new users to explore and experiment with various services at no cost for up to 12 months.

## Why AWS is Popular for Cloud Solutions

- **Scalability**: AWS services scale up or down based on demand.
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and availability across multiple AZs.
- **Security**: AWS offers strong security controls and encryption features.
